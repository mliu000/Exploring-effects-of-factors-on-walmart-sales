# Exploring the effects of different factors on the weekly sales of walmart stores

***Abstract***

About:

This project was initially done as a group project for a third year stats class at UBC. The original completed project can be found in the **Original Finished Project** folder, where the coding was performed in a .qmd file, and the report was written in a google docs file. After reviewing the original finished report, I noticed several improvements that could be made. Thus, I decided to combine the code and report into a single jupyter notebook, while enhancing descriptions/text that lead to ambiguity. The combined and improved version of our group project can be found in the file **Final_Report_Updated.ipynb** jupyter notebook file. 

The dataset we are using contains weekly sales data from 45 arbitrarily chosen storess across the United States, and was mostly recorded between the years of 2010 to 2012. It was scraped from the official website of Amazon through BeautifulSoup and WebDriver using Python. For the purposes of our analysis, we carefully chose one store as the the representative store, and used a **multiple linear regression** model with **backwards selection** to analze the relationships between weekly sales and other factors. The programming language of choide is **R**.

Motivation and Potential Implications:

The sales of any store is very complex and can be influenced by many factors, such as the store's location, layout, and more. The goal of this project was to study the effects of various external and environmental factors, such as Fuel Price, Temperature, whether a holiday existed on the Weekly Sales Revenue of a Walmart store. From the results of our analysis, it could allow stores to potentially forecast their weekly sales (based on expected fuel price, temperature, etc), from that, more accurately import stock (so there aren't too many leftovers or have it run out too quicly), as well as hire an appropriate amount of workers.
